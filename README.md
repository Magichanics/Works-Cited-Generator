# Works Cited Generator (APA Format)
### Author: Jan Garong

Python desktop application that will generate a Works Cited sheet for research papers and high school assignments.

How to use:
1. Paste into the text field a list of urls, each on a separate line. Remember that each line in the text field should have their own url, and nothing else.

2. Press the "Get CSV Metadata" button to produce a csv file that will be used later to generate a Works Cited sheet. Feel free to modify the generated spreadsheet, as well as fill in any blanks or edit the spreadsheet, since the application may not have extracted all of the information required to produce a correct citation.

3. Press the "Get Works Cited Sheet", and import the spreadsheet produced from the second step to create your Works Cited page. Soon, the program will ask where you would like to save the Works Cited page in .docx format. 

Once you have completed all three of these steps, you should have a Works Cited page done in APA format.
